# Dogecoin-Price-Prediction
In this project, we will be implementing a machine learning model which can predict the pattern or forecast the price of the coin in the upcoming days based on past data

Some Python libraries which is used in this project:

#Pandas – This library helps to load the data frame in a 2D array format and has multiple functions to perform analysis tasks in one go.
#Numpy – Numpy arrays are very fast and can perform large computations in a very short time.
#Matplotlib/Seaborn – This library is used to draw visualizations.
